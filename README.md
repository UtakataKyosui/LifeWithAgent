Welcome to your new [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) project! We're excited to see what you build.

This starter provides you with a general-purpose Mastra agent that can research current information, manage multi-step tasks, work with local files, run approved shell commands, and create recurring schedules.

## Features

- A local `workspace/` for files and command execution (created under `src/mastra/public/workspace/` when running `mastra dev`)
- Approval gates for file changes, deletions, and shell commands
- Conversation memory, generated thread titles, and task tracking
- Built-in web search and direct web page fetching
- Recurring schedules that persist across restarts
- Cloudflare D1 storage and a Workers AI binding
- A bundled Mastra skill that helps coding agents use current Mastra APIs

## Get started

This project runs locally on the Cloudflare Workers runtime, not on `mastra dev`. `pnpm run dev` fails because `src/mastra/index.ts` imports `cloudflare:workers`, and Mastra Studio is not available locally. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`, log in with `pnpm exec wrangler login`, then run:

```shell
pnpm build
pnpm exec wrangler dev
```

The Mastra API is served under [http://localhost:8787/api](http://localhost:8787/api/agents).

Try one of these prompts with the agent:

- `Get the weather forecast for Austin this weekend.`
- `Create a landing page for a Japanese sakura festival.`
- `Check the SPCX stock price now, then check it every minute.`

The agent asks for approval before it changes files or runs commands. When it creates a schedule, it returns an ID that you can use to pause the schedule.

## Workspace safety

The local filesystem tools stay inside the `workspace/` directory, which resolves relative to the server's working directory (`src/mastra/public/workspace/` during `mastra dev`). Shell commands start in that directory, but `LocalSandbox` does not provide operating-system isolation by default. Review command approvals carefully, and do not expose this template through an unauthenticated public server.

## Storage

The Cloudflare D1 database `life-with-agent-db` (binding `DB`) stores agent memory, tasks, and schedules. During `wrangler dev`, D1 is simulated locally under `.wrangler/state/`.

Recurring schedules continue to use model tokens until you pause them. Ask the agent to pause a schedule with the ID returned by `start_schedule`.

## Making it yours

- Edit `src/mastra/agents/agent.ts` to change the model, instructions, memory, workspace, or approval policy.
- Edit `src/mastra/tools/` to customize scheduling.
- Edit `src/mastra/index.ts` to change storage and observability.
- Add files or reusable skills under `src/mastra/public/workspace/` for the agent to use during `mastra dev`.
